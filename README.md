# Theory of Sovereign Reflectivity (TSR) - Coq Formalization

This repository contains a formal verification of key concepts from the Theory of Sovereign Reflectivity (TSR) using the Coq proof assistant. The formalization demonstrates that the TSR framework is internally consistent, particularly focusing on the "resistance contrast filter" mechanism.

## Overview

The Theory of Sovereign Reflectivity proposes that consciousness and reality exist in a reflective relationship, where our inner state (beliefs and emotions) influences our experience of external reality. This formalization focuses on proving that this filtering mechanism is logically consistent - specifically, that it cannot produce contradictions regardless of inputs.

## Repository Contents

- `tsr.v`: The main Coq file containing type definitions, functions, and proofs
- `Theory of Sovereign Reflectivity.md`: A comprehensive document explaining the theory
- `simple.v`: A simple example Coq file for testing purposes

## Key Concepts Formalized

The formalization includes:

1. **Type Definitions**:
   - `Belief`: Positive, Negative, or Neutral beliefs with strength values
   - `Emotion`: Joy, Fear, or Neutral emotions with intensity values
   - `Data`: External events or Potentials (with probability)
   - `Result`: Outcomes of the filtering process (Manifested, Filtered_out, or Error)

2. **Core Functions**:
   - `resistance_level`: Calculates resistance based on beliefs and emotions
   - `execute_filter`: The main function that processes data through beliefs/emotions

3. **Theorems and Proofs**:
   - `no_self_contradiction`: Proves that the filter never produces Error results
   - `filter_consistency`: The main lemma showing the filter cannot produce contradictions

## The Main Lemma

The central proof in this formalization is:

```coq
Lemma filter_consistency :
  forall b e d, ~ (execute_filter b e d = Error "contradiction").
```

This lemma proves that for any belief `b`, emotion `e`, and data `d`, the execute_filter function will never return an "Error contradiction" result. This confirms that the TSR framework is internally consistent - the resistance contrast filter mechanism cannot produce logical contradictions regardless of the inputs.

## Prerequisites

To compile and verify these proofs, you need:

- [Coq Proof Assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/) (version 8.10 or later recommended)

## How to Compile and Verify

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the repository directory
3. Compile the Coq file:

   ```
   coqc tsr.v
   ```

4. If no errors appear, the compilation was successful
5. To interactively explore the proofs:

   ```
   coqide tsr.v
   ```

   or

   ```
   emacs tsr.v
   ```

   (with ProofGeneral installed)

## Philosophical Significance

This formalization demonstrates that the TSR framework is mathematically sound. While the theory makes claims about consciousness and reality that extend beyond what can be fully captured in a formal system, this proof shows that at least the core filtering mechanism is free from logical contradictions.

The proof supports the philosophical claim in TSR that reality filtering through beliefs/emotions may alter your experience but won't create logical contradictions in the process.

## Future Work

Potential extensions to this formalization could include:

1. Formalizing the "vibrational lensing" concept from TSR
2. Adding probabilistic reasoning to model the statistical effects of group consciousness
3. Incorporating temporal aspects to model how consciousness effects evolve over time
